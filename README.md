# Gutenberg: Web Typography Starter Kit
## Producing beautiful web typography on a large scale
Gutenberg is a work–in–progress project by [Matej Latin](http://matejlatin.co.uk). Its' main goal is to set up a vertical (baseline) grid and to improve the layout by setting the proper vertical rhythm. This results in improved readability, visual hierarchy and reduced reader's eye fatigue.

##Features
- **Modular scale**: all sizes are based on calculations from Minor Third scale — [modularscale.com](http://modularscale.com).
- **3 predefined themes**: use one of the 3 predefined themes or load custom fonts.
- **Vertical rhythm**: margins and element sizes fall nicely into the baseline grid (Toggle Grid button in example).
- **Mobile First**: displays beautifully on both mobile and desktop screens.
- **Image resize**: a lightweight and easy to use jQuery script that resizes the images so their heights don't break the vertical rhythm (baseline grid).
- **Made With SASS**: Very clean and easy to understand code. Easy to customize.
- **Flexible**: Make changes and personalize this kit by changing typefaces, sizes, line-height etc.
- **Uses REMs**: All sizes and margins are defined with REMs with a fallback to pixels.

##To Do
- fix the issue of decimals seemingly breaking the grid
- check browser compatibility
