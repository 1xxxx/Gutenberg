# Web Typography
Basic web typography set with Modular Scale compliant with vertical rhythm. Serves as a foundation for further projects.


##Features
- Modular scale: all font sizes are set based on the Minor Third modular scale (modularscale.com),
- vertical rhythm: all font sizes and margins are compliant to the vertical rhythm grid based on the line-height (check Toggle Grid in example),
- responsive: two scales (for mobile and for tablet & desktop), separated by one breakpoint at 600 px
- imgFixHeight: a lightweight and easy to use jQuery script that resizes the images so their heights don't break the vertical rhythm grid.
